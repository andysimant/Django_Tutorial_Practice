# Django_Tutorial_Practice
I am following a basic Django tutorial from PythonProgramming.net and logging the stages with the work i will be progressing with.
It's almost complete now and thanks a lot to the tutorial maker for the awesome tutorial.

For using the repo :
- Just clone it or download the zip file.
- Change your working directory to the downloaded file and check if you are in the same directory where "manage.py" resides.
- Create the superuser account by running the command python manage.py runserver.
- Make the necessory migrations by-- python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate
- Run the project by python manage.py runserver
